# Governance
As of **2/13/24**, the project is only Award Malisi so we are going to with the [BDFL](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel), but it should be noted, I prefer to give myself the following title:
**ABDFL** = Alleged-Benevolent, Dictator For Life. 

If more people find themselves wanting to join the project, I'll take a look at other common programming governance strategies such as a [Meritocracy](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel).
